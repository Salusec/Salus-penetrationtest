WEB3 penetration testing refers to the security testing of applications built using blockchain technology. The main goal is to find security vulnerabilities and provide repair suggestions.Our Web3 Penetration Testing not only uncovers vulnerabilities in your network, applications and cloud services but also focuses on middleware security and anti-tampering issues in the combined parts of Web2 and blockchain in your application.

## How is it different from smart contract auditing?
WEB3 penetration testing and smart contracts are two different technological domains. Although both are related to blockchain, they have different focuses and objectives. WEB3 penetration testing refers to the security testing of applications built using blockchain technology. These applications are typically based on Web3 technology and include centralized exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, DEFI, GameFi, and other application types. The main goal of WEB3 penetration testing is to identify security vulnerabilities in the application and provide recommendations for fixing them.

## Security Risk Analysisï¼š

### [GameFi Risk](gamefi_risk.md) 
GameFi applications are considered high-risk areas for WEB3 penetration testing due to their large user base, diverse interaction scenarios, and the complexity of the games themselves.

### [DeFi Risk](defi_risk.md) 
DeFi projects should not only pay attention to the vulnerabilities related to smart contracts, but the security risks related to non-smart contracts are also fatal to DeFi applications.

### [Cefi Risk](cefi_risk.md)
Penetration testing for CeFi platforms involves addressing information leakage, account security, system security, and business scenario security risks.

### [Social Media Risk](sm_risk.md)
Decentralized blockchain products are prone to phishing attacks. Security issues in common crypto communication software require users to be more cautious.
